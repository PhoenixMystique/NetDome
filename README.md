# Why should I automate my Social Media Accounts?
It's very hard nowadays to grow an account. Have you ever been on the explore page? Platforms will show your post only to close accounts & accounts you interact most with, you will never be on the explore page. Nobody will see your beautiful photos, your hilarious memes, or whatever you are posting. But now you can do something about that! With NetDome you can __get noticed easily__, and if you really deserve it, your account will __grow super fast__!

## So, do I need to publish good content to grow?
Of course you have to! This bot will mainly help you to get the __visibility you deserve__ and which is Instagram not giving you.

## Ok but I don't know how to start this journey...
Don't worry about that now, it's not that hard to start botting with NetDome I tried to make it as noob-friendly as possible. In any case, if you follow the docs with all the steps provided, you will make it! You are also invited to join our community and ask for any help!

## There is a community around this project?
Yes! We are on __discord__ and we count a lot of __active users__ you can ask us whatever you want!

## I saw there are a lot of similar projects on GitHub, why should I choose this one?
You're right, there are plenty of other bot solutions. Most of them use API requests. However, you will get your account banned if you use API (1-30 days)!
There's also a very similar project to this one, yet it's not free and the dev doesn't care about the community much. They removed few lines from the core and ask you for a subscription plan in order to use those features. Furthermore, you don't even know what's the real code during execution - it's encrypted. And if they are stealing something else? Who knows? I don't.
This bot is __free to use__ and __open source__, you won't get charged for few extra lines, __EVER__.
I'm focused on the community and not on finding ways how to get money out of this project. __I really care about the community__ and every dev should too. ü§ó

## So this bot does not use API?
__No__ this bot is working through __adb__ and is powered by __uiautomator2__ which is a testing wrapper for Android devices. In fact, your device (or an emulator) is used for doing the botting sh*it. That's very secure compared to other botting systems around there. I also made it look as much human as possible. You can think about the bot as a __stupid__ friend using your phone and doing things for you. The example bottom is quite old but will show you what we are talking about.

## Urra! I'll never get banned anymore with this bot!
No no no, wait! ü§¶
You have to configure the bot for doing things as a human would do. Do you really spend all the day scrolling on Instagram? If yes contact a medic :P
You don't have to do so many actions or Instagram will block you. That appends even if you do that by your hands.. Have you ever added a lot of people in a row and got blocked for that action? Or spamming people with a link in PM?
__DON'T F*CKING DO THAT__

__Be gently and anonymous and nobody will notice that you're botting, trust me__.

## Do I need a computer for running the bot?
Yes, but you can also run it [directly on your phone](https://docs.gramaddict.org/#/termux)!!

In any case, you can decide to use a physical device or an emulator. If you're under Windows I suggest you use [Memu](https://www.memuplay.com/), under Mac OS we found out that [Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) works well (Installable with [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/android-studio)).
For hosting the bot you can use:
- your computer (with Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- a Raspberry (which is a cheap little pc Linux based)

Cool, isn't it? üí¶
# Quick start
Now that you're there you still don't know how to install that whole thing.
I'll try to help you accomplish that with a short tutorial. The full is available [here](https://docs.gramaddict.org/#/quickstart).


<!-- Failed? [Check this out!](https://docs.gramaddict.org/#/quickstart?id=troubleshooting) -->

<!-- # Bot crashes, what should I do?
The script isn't perfect and may fail sometimes. If this is the case you can open a ticket on our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/NK8PNEFGFF). In that way you won't share with anyone your Instagram account name üòà. We'll be very happy to help you!
 -->
<!-- # WOW! You dedicated so much time to this project! Why you did that for free??
Well, we used to be in three a long time ago but suddenly my two friends left. This has been an opportunity for me to improve my skills in Python and that's why I didn't leave the project and keep maintaining it.
But of course donations are very welcome, so if you think I did a great job you can buy me a beer :)
