# <b>InstaDome</b> is a social media automation and analytics tool for businesses ‚Äì from small to medium and even large companies. With this social media automation tool, you can expect to enjoy a ton of features such as social media scheduling, calendar management, client management, and more.

# Finally, NetDome users can analyze their social media post-performance basis how engaged their audience, influencers, demographics, and competitors are.

# The process is straightforward. All you need to do is enter a keyword of your choice that pertains to your niche. And voila! Bot will Do All other Responsibility

# Why should I automate my Social Media Accounts?
It's very hard nowadays to grow an account. Have you ever been on the explore page? Platforms will show your post only to close accounts & accounts you interact most with, you will never be on the explore page. Nobody will see your beautiful photos, your hilarious memes, or whatever you are posting. But now you can do something about that! With NetDome you can __get noticed easily__, and if you really deserve it, your account will __grow super fast__!

## So, do I need to publish good content to grow?
Of course you have to! This bot will mainly help you to get the __visibility you deserve__ and which is Instagram not giving you.

## Ok but I don't know how to start this journey...
Don't worry about that now, it's not that hard to start botting with NetDome I tried to make it as noob-friendly as possible. In any case, if you follow the docs with all the steps provided, you will make it! You are also invited to join our community and ask for any help!

<!-- # Bot crashes, what should I do?
The script isn't perfect and may fail sometimes. If this is the case you can open a ticket on our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/NK8PNEFGFF). In that way you won't share with anyone your Instagram account name üòà. We'll be very happy to help you!

<!-- # WOW! You dedicated so much time to this project! Why you did that for free??
Well, we used to be in three a long time ago but suddenly my two friends left. This has been an opportunity for me to improve my skills in Python and that's why I didn't leave the project and keep maintaining it.
But of course donations are very welcome, so if you think I did a great job you can buy me a beer :)
